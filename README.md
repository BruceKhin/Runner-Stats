Runner Stats

Runner Stats is an iPhone app, which helps you record the data of every run, including the duration, distance you covered, your instantaneous speed, your average speed, and the route on the map. It can also 'notify' you by voice whenever you run a new kilometer or mile. I start working for it since Dec 13, 2013, now it can do the above job. With the same pace, I wish I can distribute it in the next two months.


I run 5 kilometers for every test! :-D

------ Master branch is for current runnable version.
