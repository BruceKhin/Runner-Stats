Running-Stats

Running Stats is an iPhone app, which helps you record the data of every run, including the duration, distance you covered, your instantaneous speed, your average speed, and the route on the map. I start working for it about one hour a day since Dec 13, 2013, now it can do the above job. With the same pace, I wish I can distribute it in the next two months.


I run 5 kilometers for every test! :-D
