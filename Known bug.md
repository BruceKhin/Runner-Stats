Known bug:
* By output the graph's description in RSStatsSecondVC.m, I found there are two TEAContributionGraph objects being generated every time it enters the view. Don't get the reason. 
* If user turns off the voice feedback but keep the countdown seconds for 5 or 10, the countdown would not be available.
